# CauseConnect

CauseConnect aims to solve the disconnect prohibiting organizations from finding willing volunteers by providing a directory of causes, upcoming events, and users. It will function as a "LinkedIN for Volunteers."

:trophy: CauseConnect won 2nd Place Overall during the June 2018 Ironhack, Miami Full Stack Web Development Hackshow.

It was developed by [Brian Jaimes](https://github.com/B-riJ), [Kat Alderman](https://github.com/katalderman) and [Ryan Craig Martin](https://github.com/ryanmartin) in two weeks for the final project of the April-June 2018 Cohort at Ironhack, Miami.
